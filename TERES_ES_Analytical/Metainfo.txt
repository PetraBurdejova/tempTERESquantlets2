Name of QuantLet : TERES_ES_Analytical 

Published in : Tail Event Risk Expected Shortfall

Description : 'Estimates the theoretical expected shortfall of a sample for a normal Laplace mixture. This is done using a expectile based method. The calculation requires a expectile level such that it is equal to the value at risk with the predetermined risk level. This and the relevant quantile are obtained from a normal Laplace mixture.'

Keywords : expected shortfall, expectile, financial, heavy-tailed, laplace, normal, risk, risk management, risk measure,tail
